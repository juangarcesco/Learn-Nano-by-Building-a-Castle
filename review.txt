1. The first thing you need to do is start the terminal. Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type echo hello nano into the terminal and press enter.

echo hello nano

2. Use touch to create a file named castle.sh in the project folder.

touch castle.sh

3. Use the list (ls) command to make sure your file is there.

ls

4. There it is. Nano is a program for editing files that runs in the terminal. You can open a file with nano filename. Open the castle.sh file you created with Nano.

nano castle.sh

5. The terminal is showing your file in Nano. At the bottom are the commands you can use. Your file is empty right now. Add echo hello nano at the top and press control + o to "write-out", or save, the file. You will be prompted at the bottom for a filename. Leave it as castle.sh and press enter to save the file.

echo hello nano

Ctrl + o 

Enter 

6. Exit Nano by pressing control + x.

control + x

7. This will be a small bash script. You can run it with bash filename. Run your castle.sh file in the terminal.

bash castle.sh

8. You can see the command in your file ran and output text into the terminal. Open your file again with nano.

nano castle.sh

9. You can "cut" text with control + k. Move the cursor to the line with your text and remove the whole line. When you are done, save the file with control + o. Note that you cannot use a mouse to move your cursor.

control + k

Ctrl + o 

Enter 


10. You are going to draw a castle that you can print to the terminal. Add echo "" to your file. Put an empty line in between the two quotes like this:

echo "

"

Ctrl + o 

Enter 


11. You will draw the castle between the quotes. Add ground level by putting 20 underscores (_) in the row between the quotes. It should look like this:

echo "
____________________
"

12. The ^ in front of all the commands at the bottom means to press control and the letter to run the command. Exit Nano with the Exit command.

Ctrl + x

13. Use the bash command to run your castle.sh file in the terminal again.


14. Looks like it's working. Open your file with Nano.

nano castle.sh

15. Add a vertical bar, or pipe (|), at each end of your ground level. It should look like this:

echo "
|____________________|
"

16. Add another story to your castle above the ground level that has two more vertical bars. Each bar should be above your existing bars so you need spaces in between them. It should look like this:

|               	         |
|____________________|

17. Exit Nano so you can run the script again.

Ctrl + x

18. Run your file again to see the progress.

bash castle.sh

19. Open your file again so you can add some more.


20. You can use control + k to "cut" and control + u to "uncut", or paste, a line. Add five more rows like the one you just added to make your castle six stories high. Try to use the cut and paste method. It should look like this:

|              	         |
|              	         |
|____________________|

21. The existing top row is going to be the roof of the castle. Make it look like this:

|  |______________|  |

29. The M at the beginning of the other commands at the bottom stands for "meta". It's a key that doesn't exist on most keyboards. If you're on OSX it means press escape then the letter. If you are on another system, press ALT then the letter. Use the exit command to get back to the terminal.

control + x

30. Run the script to make sure things are coming along as expected.

bash castle.sh

31. That construction team must be working hard . Open the file again to continue building.

nano castle.sh

32. The top of the castle has a lookout tower on each end. Add a single row at the top of your castle to make the top look like this:

/  \                    /  \
|  |______________|  |

33. Add the peaks of your lookout towers. Put another row at the top with /\ above each lookout. It should look like this:

 /\                /\

34. Go back to the terminal with the exit command.

control + x


35. Run your script to bask in the glory of your work.

bash castle.sh

36. Oh no!!  Looks like a storm came through and blew the roof off! I think we can fix it. Open up the file.

nano castle.sh

37. I'm not quite sure what happened here... Some of the \ don't seem to be working. Try adding a space after the two \ on the top right lookout tower. Put them where these x's are:

 /\                /\(space)
/  \              /  \(space)

38. Go back to the terminal so you can run the script again.

control + x

39. Run the script to see if the roof is fixed.
bash castle.sh

40. Okay, it's all patched up. Open the file again.

nano castle.sh

41. Add some windows to your castle. Use a left and right brackets for them ([]). Put three pairs on the fourth story, like this:

|   []    []    []   |

42. Last is the door. Change the bottom two rows so there's a door right in the middle that looks like this:

|            __             |
|________|  |________|

43. Nano has a lot more features, but the basics will get you through most scenarios. Go back to the terminal with the command to exit nano.

Ctrl +  x

44. Run your script again. Hopefully the weather has been good.

bash castle.sh

45. Excellent. Open the file, I think there's one more thing you can add.

nano castle.sh

46. At the very top of the file, add another echo command with two quotes and an empty line between the quotes. In the empty line put the message, "Welcome to my castle". Here's an example:

echo "
Welcome to my castle
"
47. Go back to the terminal with the exit command so you can see if it's all done.

Ctrl +  x

48. This is the last step. Run the script to see your final product 

bash castle.sh
